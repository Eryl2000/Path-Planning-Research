# Path-Planning-Research
Unity project for current path planning research work. We hope to implement a path planning algorithm capable of avoiding obstacles while also following COLREGS, the international standard for avoiding ship collisions at sea. 


A basic presentation about the project's class structure can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NKxeycQRd9Dm35lQuZu4HEwZeU3cZs7KfaKSZpB_Gt0/edit?usp=sharing "code presentation"). Attempts were made to make the code understandable and expandable so it could serve as a test bed for future work.

## Note
Using Unity 2019.2.12f1. Older versions may work, but have not been tested.
